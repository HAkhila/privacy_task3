              <span className='collectPrivacyInform' id='access'>Who has access to your information </span><br />
              We will not sell or rent your information to third parties. We will not share your information with third parties for marketing purposes. <br />

              We may pass your information to third-party service providers, agents, subcontractors, and other associated organizations for the purposes of completing
              tasks and providing services to you on our behalf (for example to process and store information and to send you emails).  <br />
              However, if we use third-party service providers, we disclose only the personal information that is necessary to deliver the service and that requires them to<br />

              keep your information secure and not to use it for their own direct marketing purposes. We will take the necessary<br />

              steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.

              <span className='collectPrivacyInform' id='choices'>Your choices and your rights </span><br />
              You have the right to inform us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. You can exercise your right and prevent us from processing such information by checking or unchecking certain boxes on the forms <br />
              we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us by email at hi@dripp.zone. We will not contact you for marketing purposes unless you have given your prior consent.<br />
              You can change your marketing preferences at any time by contacting us by email at hi@dripp.zone.

              <span className='collectPrivacyInform' id='update' >How you can update your information </span><br />
              The accuracy of your information is important to us. If you change your email address, or any of the other information we hold is inaccurate or out of date, please email us at hi@dripp.zone. <br />
              You have the right to ask for a copy of the information DRIPP holds about you.  <br /><br />

              <span className='collectPrivacyInform' id='measures'>Security measures to protect your information </span><br />
              When you give us personal information, we take steps to ensure that it's treated securely. Non-sensitive details such as your email address may be transmitted unencrypted over the Internet, <br />
              and so may not be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information,  we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. <br />
              When we receive your information, we will make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.<br /><br />

              <span className='collectPrivacyInform' id='Newsletter'>Newsletter </span><br />
              The provisions of this Policy also apply to the request form and sending of our newsletter. The newsletter will only be sent after a prior request by the user in the so-called “double opt-in procedure” (request on our website and confirmation of a corresponding request e-mail).
              Users of the newsletter are also assigned a UserID, which allows DRIPP to determine when the relevant newsletter was opened and which links or functions from the relevant newsletter were activated. This tracking is done for the internal optimization of the newsletter.
              This data will not be passed on to third parties. DRIPP has an interest in evaluating such data for purposes of newsletter optimization and, on the other hand, a concerned person can reasonably foresee at the time when the personal data is collected and in view of the
              circumstances under which it is carried out (in particular the above-mentioned measures) that it will possibly be processed for this purpose. The user has the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. If the user of the newsletter does not wish to receive this tracking,
              he/she can unsubscribe from the newsletter. To do so, simply unsubscribe via the link in the newsletter or send an e-mail to hi@dripp.zone. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.  <br /> <br />
